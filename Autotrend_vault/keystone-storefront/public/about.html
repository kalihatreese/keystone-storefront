  <h1 style="font-size:2.5rem;">🧬 The Mutation Architect</h1>
  <p style="font-size:1.2rem; line-height:1.6;">
    Keystone AI/ML wasn’t built in a weekend. It was forged over three years of friction, failure, and obsession. Jonathan — founder, mutation architect, and automation-driven visionary — didn’t just want a storefront. He wanted a living organism. One that ingests global winners, mutates layouts, propagates virally, and earns while he sleeps.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:1.2rem; line-height:1.6;">
    He started with broken SDKs, git lock errors, and brittle legacy flows. But every blocker became a mutation. Every mutation became momentum. He wired ingestion daemons, heatmap telemetry, cart-triggered homepage evolution, and viral traffic engines across Discord, Reddit, Craigslist, TikTok, and email.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:1.2rem; line-height:1.6;">
    He built mobile GUIs to control the empire from his phone. He fused legacy bots with new viral flows. He injected vault triggers that mutate layout from external signals. He wired analytics dashboards that log every cycle. And he daemonized the whole thing — PM2, cron, deploy, repeat.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:1.2rem; line-height:1.6;">
    Keystone AI/ML is more than a storefront. It’s a mutation-grade empire. It evolves. It heals. It compounds. And now, it’s live.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:1.2rem; line-height:1.6; font-weight:bold;">
    Built by Jonathan. Mutation architect. Viral tactician. Automation obsessive. This is his system. This is his story.
