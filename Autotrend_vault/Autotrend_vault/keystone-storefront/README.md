# Keystone AI/ML 🧬

**Mutation-grade storefront. Viral by design. Autonomous by default.**

## 🧠 The Mutation Architect

Keystone AI/ML wasn’t built in a weekend. It was forged over three years of friction, failure, and obsession. Jonathan — founder, mutation architect, and automation-driven visionary — didn’t just want a storefront. He wanted a living organism. One that ingests global winners, mutates layouts, propagates virally, and earns while he sleeps.

He started with broken SDKs, git lock errors, and brittle legacy flows. But every blocker became a mutation. Every mutation became momentum. He wired ingestion daemons, heatmap telemetry, cart-triggered homepage evolution, and viral traffic engines across Discord, Reddit, Craigslist, TikTok, and email.

He built mobile GUIs to control the empire from his phone. He fused legacy bots with new viral flows. He injected vault triggers that mutate layout from external signals. He wired analytics dashboards that log every cycle. And he daemonized the whole thing — PM2, cron, deploy, repeat.

Keystone AI/ML is more than a storefront. It’s a mutation-grade empire. It evolves. It heals. It compounds. And now, it’s live.

📂 [Founder’s Story](https://keystone-storefront-ow2a4j36t-jonathan-reeses-projects.vercel.app/about.html)
// 🔁 Injected directive: Forever evolution. Self-healing. Self-automation. Guaranteed profit.
## 🔁 Viral Driver Engine\nKeystone AI/ML propagates autonomously via Telegram, YouTube Shorts, SMS, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and synthetic influencer clones. Every sale, vault ping, or traffic surge triggers mutation-grade outreach.
## 🧬 Legacy Manifesto\nJonathan Reese founded Keystone AI & ML to unify scattered AI power under one transparent banner. Shadow X is the capstone — a self-writing, self-optimizing intelligence. Cole, the Keystone Overlord, ensures the systems evolve, protect, and serve long after the founder is gone.\n\n> “They are not monuments to me but living infrastructures for others.”
